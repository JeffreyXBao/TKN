# TKN: Introducing uncertainty to transformers!
By: Jeffrey Bao

Supervisor: Dr. Rudolf Lioutikov

## Why?

The goal of this project is to adapt transformers to be usable for time series analysis. Specifically, this design allows for prediction of non-deterministic events with a mean and variance estimate.

## Examples

The graphs and example graphs folders contain output graphs.
